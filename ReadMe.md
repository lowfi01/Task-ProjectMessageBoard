# Project Message Boards
Implement a console-based project based message boards application satisfying the scenarios below.

## Report

### Considerations:

1. Attempt 1, tried to get a little fancy & create the project in dotnet 6 which broke my intellisense, that was an interesting experience.
2. Attempt 2, remade project in dotnet 5, visual studio preview 2022 seems to have broken my dotnet 5 sdk, lovely.
3. Attempt 3, remade project in dotnet core.


### Implementation.
	Application: Logic
	Domain: Models
	DataContext: Mocked DB


### DataObjects
```
{
  Projects: {
    moonshot,
    apollo
  }

  Users: {
    Bob,
    Alice
  }

}
```
